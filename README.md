## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to implement the AES-256 encryption algorithm in Rust from scratch.
I don't aim for an efficient implementation and mostly want to get comfortable with Rust.
The project aims to explore potential enhancements or modifications to the standard AES-256 algorithm,
experimenting with unique twists to further strengthen (?) its cryptographic properties or adapt it to specific use cases.\
This project will serve as mostly a learning exercise in cryptography and Rust, as well as a foundation for developing advanced encryption tools.
